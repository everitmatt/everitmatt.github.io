I am an interactive media designer currently studying a Master of Design Innovation at the School of Architecture and Design, at Victoria Univeristy of Wellington, New Zealand.

I have passion for designing innovative ways to interact with our technology, with an aim to make these interactions more synonymous with our natural behaviours. I also have a keen interest in designing artistic data visualisations which allow viewers to understand and experience datasets.

I am currently working on a thesis project which explores designing data visualisations for the local surfing community. The aim of this project is to investigate through the design of these visualisation, how a community or sub-culture can be accurately and expressively represented by data. Firstly, to represent the data in a way that is interesting and beneficial to the community or sub-culture itself. Secondly, to represent the data in a way that is interesting to the outsider.
