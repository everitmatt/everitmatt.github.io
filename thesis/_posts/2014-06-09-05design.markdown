The purpose of this research was to identify methods of visualising the relationships between a database generated by action sports trackers in surfing and the subculture of surfing. The design experimentation section researched the applicability of Computational Information Design and Complex Network Visualisation on the surfing database. This section describes the design research undertook to answer the brief defined in the previous section.

Design a web based application that visualises the surfing nation, hierarchy aspects of the surfing subculture, a surfer’s pilgrimage, and a surfer’s personal experience at a surf spot. The application should be both, interactive and allow the user to explore the database. Lastly, users of the SearchGPS Watch can ‘login’ and compare themselves within the surfing community.

One of the problems identified in the design of a big data visualisation is filtering the data to reduce visual clutter. Of the 250,000 surfs, each contained 37 variables. Therefore, a hierarchy needed to be established so that the most important variables are communicated first, and after further interaction of the visualisation more variables can be communicated. Establishing this hierarchy required a strong understanding of the database’s context, in relation to visual aesthetic. Understanding the database in a surfing context informed the design of which aspects were more important than others. This hierarchy translated directly into global, local, and personal scales. With these scales defined the development process refined the visual and interactive aesthetic of the web application.

### Global

Grouping the data geographically was a successful method of reducing the visual clutter while maintaining enough detail to convey the surf locations. This was emphasised further by the breakdown of geolocations into recognised surf spots. The distinct surf locations could be generated from a ‘detected location’ variable associated with each surf. This grouping of the data communicated the popular surf locations around the globe.

By ‘stacking’ surfs on the z-axis the amount of surf’s per location could be viewed as a 3D histogram. This visual aspect was further enhanced by the use of virtual cameras within the application. The cameras could be moved to set locations so that the histogram could be viewed traditionally in 2D, and an elevated view in 3D. The traditional histogram view allowed for a more accurate view of the surf count per location. Whereas, the 3D view allowed the viewer to identify the locations faster and was more visually engaging. Each ‘stack’ consisted of particles which represented a surf. The particles were coloured using the swell size variable and were stacked over time. This meant that each ‘stack’ visualised a timeline of swells over the year.

Implementing time in design allowed the surf particles to be animated so that surfs and swells could be visualised over time. Furthermore, the origin of the swell could be estimated to communicate where swells for certain surf spots are predominantly generated. These ‘swell emitters’ were estimated by studying global swell maps and identifying where swell was typically generated such as the areas in the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific Ocean. 

The final development in the global view was the visualisation of the professional surfer’s location’s and the location where the user had surfed. This visualisation was to efficiently establish where the top surfers are surfing, whether it be in the popular locations, or more remote locations; and where the user had been surfing. This visual allows the user to compare his locations to the professionals, to popular locations, or to see how far they have travelled around the globe in search of the perfect wave. These locations were visualised using semi-transparent columns which overlaid that location’s ‘stack’.

### Local

The local view of the web application focuses on visualising the hierarchy and pilgrimage of surfers to the selected location. The aim is to communicate the top surfers in that location and the international journey surfer’s may undertake to surf a specific spot. For example, Manu Bay in Raglan, New Zealand is rated very highly both nationally and internationally (Hersey, 2012), this could be due to the surf spots appearance in the 1996 surf film Endless Summer. Therefore, by visualising the pilgrimage of a surfer from another country to a surf spot we generate knowledge of whether the surf spot is known internationally. Furthermore, by introducing visitors to the break we begin to visualise who the ‘locals’ at the surf spot are and generate a hierarchy based on those surfers statistics at a certain break. 

The pilgrimage of the surfer to location is visualised using a flight path technique. An arc animates from the direction of their previous location and tracks into the current surf location. Furthermore, when seen from a bird’s-eye view these flight paths generate a compass of previous locations. This method allows the viewer to efficiently establish if a given location is the target of many surfing pilgrimages. 

The data allows each individual surf in the selected location be totalled per user, this means that the maximum of each statistic can be identified to visualise the hierarchy of that location. For example, the user with the most surfs, most waves, top speed and others, can be identified. Once the top surfers are identified these filters can be applied to show the top user’s surfs in the location. Each surf is visualised using a similar stack method to the global view, where the stack height is dependent of the waves per surf. This allows the viewer to see the relationship between the variables, such as surf count and wave count. The viewer with the largest surf count may not have the largest wave count.

Another aspect that was visualised in the local view was the estimated swell direction over time. By using the ‘swell direction’ variable associated with each surf  a lined plane could be rotated to visualise the direction of the swell hitting that surf spot at a specific time. This aspect is useful in communicating which breaks people are surfing within a surf spot depending on the swell direction. Most surf breaks have ideal conditions where the wind, tide, and swell combined to generate the best possible wave at that location. Therefore, by visually associating a surf from the database with the swell conditions at the surf spot we can begin to understand which break surfers are surfing depending on the swell. 

The hierarchy of the users in each location can also be understood through a combination of location of surfs at the surf spot, and wave count. For example, most surf spots contain a higher level break than the others such as The Wall in Lyall Bay, New Zealand. In the right conditions this wave creates a world class surf break which surfers compete over to get their wave. Through the visualisation of a surfer’s position within a surf spot over time, the data can demonstrate their ability or ranking within the hierarchy. In the local view of Lyall Bay, surfers with high wave count could be seen surfing mostly around the The Wall rather than the beach break, where surfers with a much lower wave count were surfing.

### Personal

The personal view explores a surfing session to illustrate aspects such as positioning within a surf spot, the amount of time paddling versus the time spent on a wave, and the different styles of waves per location. The view uses a mixture of cameras to provide an in depth view of the surf session and highlights when waves are caught by manipulating time. This view relies on the database generated by the proxy application from Experiment Two and generates a proof of concept of what could be achieved if all the data from the SearchGPS database was available. The researcher used both the watch and the application together so that the surf session data could be added manually for this visualisation. The GPS surf track is captured by the watch and in future implementations of this application would be used, however, this data lacks the acceleration and rotation which is captured by the application.

By implementing the successful methods from Experiment Two this view creates a surf footprint that efficiently communicates a surfer’s movements throughout a surf session. A surfer’s paddling movements through the water are illustrated by groups of ellipses, these create a general pattern that also emphasises the “wandering” of a surfer looking for the right position to catch a wave. Whereas, lines of different strokes widths visualise the surfers ride to emphasise the precise trail of the wave and illustrate the style of wave. For example, in experiment two, the difference between a wave running off a break-wall and a wave running along a sand-bar could be seen. This type of knowledge is usually understood by the surfer as they move between positions depending on tides and swells. Therefore, successfully visualising these aspects is important in generating knowledge for the viewer.

The final design decision in the personal view focused on the camera angles being used. With the aim of this view being to illustrate a surfer’s experience in the surf, the decision was made to mix traditional camera angles from surfing media, shot from the beach or a position in the water, with newer camera angles such as drones (Pipeline Winter, 2013) or interactive 360 degree cameras (GoPro, 2015). These could be switched to place the viewer in the position of the surfer or to view the surf from the beach or the sky. The newer technologies attempt to create a more immersive environment for the viewer to experience surfing. The options also allow the viewer to interact and dictate their view of the surfing session. 

### Narrative & Interactivity

As a designer, it is important to construct the application in a way that fosters exploration of the database while emphasising the most important factor of the subculture which were identified through the design process. The application was designed to work both as a linear web experience, where the journey through the surfing nation over a year  could run automatically and was curated by the designer; and as a database exploration tool, where the viewer could explore certain locations that interested them or follow a certain user who exhibited a specific relationship to the viewer.

The narrative aspect of the visualisation acts as an introduction to the database, highlighting top locations and top users over the year while moving through each view. This function demonstrates the level of detail and time contained within each view so that when the user has the option to explore they understand where they sit contextually with each other. Conceptually if the viewer is a searchGPS user they could log-in and place themselves within the narrative, creating a ‘year in review’ visualisation similar to the Your Year project (AKQA, 2014). From here users can explore the database further by selecting certain locations.

The design approach answered the brief by applying the successful methods and responding to the unsuccessful methods analysed in the design experimentation stage. The design implemented a hierarchy of variables based on their ability to communicate the cultural aspects of hierarchy, pilgrimage and the surfers experience with the waves. The hierarchy of variables allowed each cultural aspect to be emphasised through specific views, global, local, and personal; and the most suitable visualisation techniques to these aspects. The web application creates a system through which to experience the database generated by a sample of the surfing nation, and communicates knowledge through this experience.
