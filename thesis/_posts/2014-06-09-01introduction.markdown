The integration of wearable technologies in sports as a means to track performance and experience has become a trend in the last few years (Mitchell, 2014). Earlier examples of wearable technology for tracking activities focused mainly on geo-location, speed and biometrics such as heart rate (Fitbit, 2016) to give the user feedback on their performance. As the technology has advanced certain devices are now able to capture data associated with the user’s motion in real world space. For example, Trace (2015) allows surfers to capture the motion of their surfboard while riding a wave by attaching a waterproof Global Positioning System (GPS) sensor and motion sensor to their surfboard. These action sports trackers are focused on collecting the data for the user to review and share with friends. As a result, large databases are being created which contain digitised representations of the participating communities. 

Generating meaning or knowledge from these big databases can be difficult, especially when they contain a complex number of variables. However, Tufte (2001) defines the use of graphics as the most effective way to explore and summarise large data sets. The database generated by a global surfing community includes up to 1000 surfs per day, with each surf containing data associated with waves caught, distances travelled, speeds, and so on. A data visualisation communicates relationships between these factors efficiently by taking advantage of the human visual system’s ability to understand patterns (Fry, 2004). The designer’s responsibility is to analyse the variables and establish their importance in the communication of this information. Therefore, understanding the context of the data is of great importance in the design of data visualisations.

This thesis asks: can an interactive data visualisation illustrate the hierarchical, nomadic, and experiential aspects of the surfing subculture? In response to this question, this research analysed data generated by surfers in relation to the surfing subculture through a series of design experiments. These experiments aimed to firstly, imitate the capture capabilities of action sports trackers, to capture and visualise a surfers intent to surf, and capture and visualise the action of surfing. Secondly, to visualise existing data generated by the current action sports trackers. These experiments aimed to establish important data variables and their relationship to certain aspects of the surfing subculture, and methods of visualising said variables so that they were representative of the subculture. The final output of this research attempted to utilise the successful methods from the design experiments to visualise the sample database so that aspects of the surfing subculture could be explored.

Throughout the research a model of the final data visualisation emerged in response to the review of the surfing subculture and the design process. The model consisted of three views, global, local, and personal. Each of these views was designed to disseminate specific aspects of the surfing subculture. For example, the global view provided a macro view of the surfing nation, the local view broke down the surfing nation to communicate local hierarchy and the surfer’s pilgrimage, and the personal view provided an in-depth surf break down for a specific users, this will be referred to as the experience for the duration of this thesis.

The literature review of this thesis reviewed current literature and design to identify successful methods and to establish areas where this research could contribute. This section focused on data visualisation research to identify methods for visualising complex data, surfing subculture literature to better understand the context of the data being visualised and to create a cultural criteria, and precedent designs to establish methods of visualising data with strong contextual relationships.

The design experiments chapter outlines the applicability of the visualisation methods and cultural criteria identified in the Literature Review. These experiments either consolidated the cultural criteria, identified new aspects, or identified inapplicable aspects. Throughout this process the visualisation methods were applied to the cultural criteria to create a brief for the final design.

The design section of this thesis covers the development of the process the final application, Gone Surfing, in response to the brief defined through the design experiments. This section focused on the development  on the global, local, and personal views as means of communicating the developed cultural aspects most effectively.

The discussion chapter discusses the conclusions from the final design and their implications within contemporary design, it goes on to identify the pitfalls of the design. Finally, the chapter identifies further areas of research.

It is important in the reading of this thesis to understand the background of technologies within the surfing subculture. Surfing is not ignorant of the digital age. Many professional surfers taking advantage of social media to share short surf clips weekly which creates a steady stream of visual impetus for surfers. These surfers usually have a photographer or videographer following them continuously to capture the perfect shot. Amateur surfers do not have this liberty, therefore they take advantage of devices such as the GoPro action sports camera. These small cameras can be held, worn, or attached to a surfboard to capture first person video of the surfing experience. Although these devices are very effective, they can sometimes be distractions in the surf. Therefore, a more covert device for capturing a surfer’s experience may permit a more immersive experience. The SearchGPS Watch and Trace action sports tracker are examples of more covert technologies to record a surf, and as part of this research a mobile application, Surfone, was designed to replicate these devices.

The SearchGPS Watch (Rip Curl, 2014) tracks the geo-location of the surfer to record statistics while remaining covert in its nature. The watch tracks statistics such as top speed and the number of waves caught per session and then allows the user to share this data with other watch users. Members of Rip Curl’s professional surf team also participate so that users can compare themselves to the top tier of surfing. The outcome of this data collection is a quantitative database covering a global community of surfers. The database provides an opportunity to visualise the surfing subculture so that parts of its more complex substructure can be revealed. A sample of this database was released for the use in this research.

The complex nature of the surfing subculture has been defined in literature. However, the opportunity to overlay these theories with such a comprehensive database has not been done. According to Stranger (2011) the surfing subculture consists of a surface generated by the commercial powers in surfing and a complex substructure of neo-tribes which is held together by the transcendent experience of which “only a surfer knows the feeling” (Stranger, 2011). The surface consists of the general symbols and media associated with surfing such as films and magazines. Whereas the substructure consists of neo-tribes held together by implicit knowledge, observations, and shared experiences by the participants. The database which is being generated by the action sports trackers adds a quantifiable layer to these tribes and their experiences and provides an opportunity to make the substructure more accessible to non-participants.

Action sports trackers are translating the surfing subculture into databases which can be powerful tool of cultural expression in the computer age. According to Manovich (2007) the database is a “symbolic form of the modern age”. He further references Jean-Francois Lyotard’s Postmodern Condition, on the database as “a new way to structure our experience of ourselves and of the world”. This structure differs from the conventional narrative approach of cinema, rather, it is a collection of items with significance to each other. The translation of these experiences from database to information and so on to knowledge can be achieved through data visualisation. The visual design of information can aid in the understanding of data (Fry, 2004), however due to the large quantity of data, special techniques should be implemented.

As part of understanding our experiences in the world, we can begin by understanding ourselves. Li, Dey, & Forlizzi (2010) describe the field of personal informatics facilitates an understanding of self-knowledge through the collection and reflection of information about oneself . Specific motivations for those who take part in this practice according to Choe et al (2014) are: to improve health, to improve other aspects of life, or to find new life experiences. Action sports trackers have likely emerged from the field of personal informatics, specifically, for those aiming to learn something interesting about their participation in the sport or to improve their abilities.
