<p>The aim of this project is to design a visualisation of data captured from a global community of surfers. The experiments aim to provide insight into the technology and techniques needed to successfully develop a design that illustrates the surfing subculture, and develop and validate the cultural criteria.</p>

<p>The methods used by this research as defined in the methodology section revolves around the capture, exploration, mapping, and iteration of data. These steps are important in understanding the applicability of the techniques used to acquire the data and the applicability of the dataset. The first two experiments capture data associated with checking the surf via web services and the data of a physical surf. Respectively, these experiments analyse the intent and action of a surfer. Each experiment can be divided into capture and visualisation stages. The data is captured and explored in its raw form to try and identify pieces of information that should be visualised. The visualisation allows the connections to be mapped and to identify whether the databases’ context is relevant. The final experiment focuses on the exploration and mapping of the database generated by the SearchGPS Watch (Rip Curl, 2014). </p>

<p>The first experiment identified users on swell forecasting websites and their location to understand a surfer’s desire or intent to go surfing.  The second experiment replicated current action sports trackers by tracking a surfing session. This experiment aimed to capture and visualise the experience of being in the surf. The third experiment visualised the global database generated by the SearchGPS Watch (Rip Curl, 2014) to evaluate its applicability to this project. This experiment differs from the previous two because of the lack of control of the data capture process. The database was already being generated before this project began and continues to grow.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-1">Experiment 1</h3>

<p><img src="http://everittcreative.me/assets/thesis/north.png" alt="Intent Paths, North Island, New Zealand" /></p>

<p>The first experiment was designed to explore methods for capturing and visualising a surfer’s intent to surf by tracking a user’s visits to swell forecasting websites. For example, a surfer located in Wellington, New Zealand, may be viewing surf spots 2 to 3-hours drive from their location. This experiment included design problems associated with tracking users on the web, and visualising which surf spots a user viewed in relation to their current location. This experiment also hinted at the nomadic nature of surfing participants by capturing a surfers international movements over time.</p>

<p>Computers and mobile devices have the capability to accurately locate where users are in the world. Many visualisations take advantage of these data points to visualise where people are moving and communicating within the world. Just Landed (Thorpe, 2009) demonstrates this by visualising tweets (from Twitter users). <img src="http://everittcreative.me/assets/thesis/wellington.png" alt="Intent Paths, Wellington, New Zealand" /> By using the location of tweets containing the words ‘just landed’ and comparing that to the user’s profile location, flight paths could be visualised. Thorpe’s method of visualisation consisted of a map containing arcs from the user’s original location to the ‘just landed’ location. They effectively showed a user’s movements over time. Therefore, similar methods were employed in the first experiment.</p>

<p>Experiment One consisted of 10 university-aged surfers based in Wellington, New Zealand, using a chrome web extension that tracked which swell forecasting sites they visited and their location when they visited it. The sites included swellmap.com, Magicseaweed, SURF2SURF, and Surf-forecast.com. Whenever a user visited one of these sites a package of data would be sent to the database. This package contained anonymous user id, timestamp, location (latitude, longitude), and the url of the website visited. The url would contain the location name that could then be matched with a database containing the locations of each surf spot. For example, ‘loyal bay’ could be extracted from this url: http://www.swellmap.co.nz/surfing/new-zealand/lyall-bay. <img src="http://everittcreative.me/assets/thesis/samoa1.png" alt="Intent path to samoa" /> The database that was generated by the web extension was then visualised using arcs between a user’s location and the surf spots they had viewed on a Google Map. Each user was assigned a separate colour and the visualisation could be viewed over time as an animation and in a static state.</p>

<p>After a month, the experiment collected just under 300 usable data points gathered from 10 participants. Most of the users were viewing local surf spots all within 2-hours drive. More specific groupings began to emerge (during the university break). Users could be seen accessing the websites from other locations around New Zealand, such as Gisborne and Christchurch. Even from these locations, the users were still viewing surf spots within a 2-hour drive. However, one user, located in Wellington, was viewing surf spots in Samoa. The extension then recorded the user viewing the same surf spots from a location in Samoa. The visualisation had communicated a surfer’s intent to surf in Samoa and also tracked their pilgrimage to Samoa.</p>

<p><img src="http://everittcreative.me/assets/thesis/samoa2.png" alt="Intent paths in samoa" /></p>

<p>The aim of this experiment was to identify a group of surfer’s intent to surf—through the capture and visualisation of data associated with the practice of viewing swell forecasting websites. Therefore, quantifying an aspect of the surfing subculture and qualitatively evaluated it through data visualisation. Due to the small number of participants there was insufficient data for this experiment to go further. However, the arc visualisation methods from Just Landed (Thorpe, 2009) effectively communicated a surfer’s intent to surf. The pilgrimage of the surfer to other countries visualised in this experiment was also identified in Experiment Three. This aspect of the subculture was identified in both the literature and design experiments. Therefore, it became an important aspect in the final design.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-2">Experiment 2</h3>

<p>The second experiment explored the generation and visualisation of a database pertaining to the physical action of surfing, specifically, paddling on the board to position oneself to catch a wave and the movements associated with catching and riding a wave. The SearchGPS Watch and the Trace action sports trackers both capture data generated from a surfing session, then allow the user to review the session via a mobile application. The aim of the experiment was firstly, to understand what surfing data should be captured, and secondly, to define methods of visualising a surf session in ways that communicated the surfing experience.</p>

<p><img src="http://everittcreative.me/assets/thesis/screen-shot-2011-07-21-at-12-27-38-pm.png" alt="Nike+ City Runs (YesYesNo, 2016)" /></p>

<p>The data generated by the SearchGPS Watch is visualised on a Google Map in a static form that the user can then zoom and pan. This is contrasted with Nike+ City Runs (YesYesNo, 2016), a visualisation that generates animated GPS traces according to user’s running patterns. The runner’s track is viewed from a ‘drone’ style camera—because it is revealed over time, it slowly reveals shapes of the city. This creates a compelling visual which establishes relationships both with time, location, and speed—factors which are lost in the SearchGPS visualisation. The visualisation methods used to create this successful visualisation were explored in this design experiment. </p>

<p>The SearchGPS Watch and the Trace restrict the access to the raw data produced. Therefore, a proxy mobile application was designed so that similar data could be captured in order to be visualised. <img src="http://everittcreative.me/assets/thesis/export.png" alt="Surfer motion visualisation" /> The design of the proxy application for this experiment focused on capturing two levels of data, the gps track of the surf, and the actual movement of the surfer on the wave. The application named Surfone used the GPS and motion sensor capabilities of mobile devices (commonly used to control gaming, or track running on mobile devices) in an attempt to capture a surfer in a three dimensional (3D) virtual space. The device can be placed in a waterproof case on the back of a surfer using a custom pocket in their wetsuit. At the end of a surf, all the data can then be sent to the online database to be visualised. For this experiment, the researcher acted as participant and attempted to use the application to record a surfing session. Once a session was captured, the data was then stored in an online database for visualisation. </p>

<p><img src="http://everittcreative.me/assets/thesis/Screen_Shot_2015-10-27_at_2.42.20_PM.png" alt="Surf Footprint, Fitzroy Bay" /> </p>

<p>The Processing Development Environment was used as a tool for visualising the action of surfing in way that demonstrated the relationships prevalent within a surf session. The initial visualisation explored motion of the surfer’s body. The second visualisation explored the gps track, and the speed of the surfer. The motion of the surfer can be measured via rotation and acceleration. These measurements were used to drive an animation of a rectangular prism representative of the surfer. This visualisation projected the movements of a surfers torso into a virtual environment. The GPS track and speed were visualised by animating the location of the surfer over a Google Map. By creating a speed threshold of 10 kilometres per hour, waves could be identified. These were visualised by lines, and the time spent paddling was represented by small circles.</p>

<p>The results from Experiment Two extended the traditional visualisations of the commercial products by animating the GPS tracking data and adding another layer of data for multivariate analysis. For example, the colour value of the GPS track could be used to visualise the speed, rotation, or acceleration of the surfer. Therefore, the movements of the surfer could be visualised in relation to their position in the surf. The visualisation determined when a surfer was in the sitting or prone position, as well as where a turn was performed on the wave. </p>

<p><img src="http://everittcreative.me/assets/thesis/lyall01.png" alt="Stylised Surf Footprint, Lyall Bay" /> </p>

<p>Because the data was collected multiple times at an individual surf spot (The Wall, Lyall Bay, Wellington, New Zealand), conclusions were drawn on the style of waves compared to the position of the surfer. Loyal Bay has a few distinct breaks—one which which breaks off the break wall and runs to the right as seen from the beach (in surfers’ terms this would be called a left hand point break), and another further down the beach which breaks on the sand bar and runs to the left as viewed from the beach (right hand beach break). The visualised data illustrated the different directions of the surf breaks. When a wave was caught at The Wall, the surfer would move perpendicular to the beach. Whereas when a wave was caught at the beach break the surfer’s movements were more parallel to the beach. The visualisation also communicated the paddling movements of the surfer in their attempt to position themselves to catch a wave.</p>

<p>The aim of this experiment was to determine methods of visualising the surfing experience. The visualisation communicated implicit knowledge of the surf spot. By showing the way in which the waves break, this experiment subverts a cultural knowledge learnt by the surfer through years of experience in the surf  (Stranger, 2011).</p>

<h3 id="experiment-3">Experiment 3</h3>

<p><img src="http://everittcreative.me/assets/thesis/Screen_Shot_2015-12-11_at_11.59.13_AM_copy_copy.png" alt="Popular surf locations, California" /></p>

<p>The final experiment in this research was a response to the sample of data released by Rip Curl from the SearchGPS Watch database and consolidated the aspect of pilgrimage, identified false positives, and provided this research with its first visualisation of the global surfing community. The previous experiments investigated methods of capturing data which could be implemented efficiently in the scope of this project. These came about because of a lack of access to the data generated by the commercial trackers already in use (SearchGPS and Trace). With the release of a sample of this data this experiment was able to work with a database generated by the global surfing community.</p>

<p>The Rip Curl database covered a year’s worth of surfing from over 9,000 users, totalling over 250,000 surfs. The experiment aimed to identify the applicability of this database to this project. It also explored the technological requirements of visualising big data. This data was donated after experiments one and two had been completed and became the core of the data used in the final project. This was combined with the data captured from Experiment Two to create a more complete database that ranged from a global to a personal level.</p>

<p>With a large database, newer technologies for parsing, filtering, and mining large amounts of data were employed to make working with the data easier for the designer. The database’s used in the previous experiment were small, five megabytes at the most. In comparison, the Rip Curl database was over 80 megabytes. Google’s Big Query is a tool for querying large databases with a set of rules, so that the smaller sections of the database can be returned. For example, the database could be queried to return a surf’s location, unique ID, and timestamp. This reduces the size of the data being worked with by 80%. This is useful when experimenting with the data to efficiently work with certain variables and add more variables if needed.</p>

<p><img src="http://everittcreative.me/assets/thesis/Screen_Shot_2016-02-04_at_10.10.29_AM.png" alt="Shipping lanes visualisation (Kenny, 2012)" /></p>

<p>WebGL is a browser based technology which allows a website to take advantage of a computer’s graphics processing capabilities. This feature has been implemented by designers wanting to create more immersive web experience and the visualisation of complex particle systems (Chrome Experiments, 2016). WebGL has also been used to visualise large databases, typically geographic in nature. A shipping lanes visualisation (Kenny, 2012) implements WebGL with Google Maps to visualise over 200,000 points gathered from ships. This visualisation was created to demonstrate how Google’s big data toolset can work with WebGL. Furthermore, it visualised information of global shipping industry such as popular shipping lanes and false positives such as offshore oil rigs. Not only can these points be animated smoothly they are also interactive. The interactivity allows the user to hover over a ship to get further information such as the course and speed of the ship. These factors contributed to this experiment’s shift to WebGL.</p>

<p><img src="http://everittcreative.me/assets/thesis/Screen_Shot_2015-11-06_at_11.41.56_AM_copy.png" alt="International pilgrimage visualisation" /></p>

<p>The visualisation sketches for this experiment began by visualising just over 3000 surfs from the month of January. This was done using the Processing Development Environment and an external Google Maps library. These initial sketches established surf locations and movements of users from one location to another. Visualising these movements communicated many surfers’ nomadic tendencies. The tendencies ranged from extreme cases such as one user who travelled between Australia and Hawaii many times over one month, to less extreme such as users travelling from Australia to Indonesia and spending more than a couple of weeks in that location. This second group are examples of surfer’s who make a pilgrimage to popular locations. The pilgrimage was explored further in the final design stages so that it could be communicated more effectively.</p>

<p>Using newer web technologies in this experiment identified the limits of the computer’s ability to visualise large amounts of data on the screen. The visualisation in this experiment placed every surf on a global map so that the relationships between these statistics could be analysed. By utilising WebGL in this experiment most of the processing power required to visualise the large dataset was passed on to the graphics processor of the computer. This allowed for the 250,000 to be visualised on a single map. It also meant that the colour, size and transparency could be altered to represent statistics such as, swell size, wave count, and session duration.</p>

<p><img src="http://everittcreative.me/assets/thesis/Screen_Shot_2015-11-27_at_10.08.21_PM_copy.png" alt="SearchGPS database Surf geo-locations" /></p>

<p>By plotting the location on Google Maps, ‘surfs’ in locations not near surf spots could be identified as alternative activities, this was emphasised using the color of points to denote speed. For example, a specific user’s surfs were located in Lake Geneva, Switzerland. This could mean that the user was participating in a flat water based sport such as waterskiing, wake boarding, or jet skiing. When visualised with speed as a variable the user could be seen travelling at speeds over 40 kilometres per hour, which is much faster than most surfers would travel on a wave. Another example is ‘surf’ locations found in mountain ranges such as the French Alps and the Japanese Alps. These are most likely winter sports sessions such as skiing or snowboarding. These false positives were important to keep in mind during the final design process.</p>

<p>Interactivity is an important feature which enables a multivariate analysis of the database. Yi et al (2007) highlights the importance of interactions as “a way to overcome the limits of representation and augment a user’s cognition”. The previous paragraph established the analysis of the visualisation with different variables as a key factor in identifying outliers. This analysis was executed in the Processing application through code which is not user friendly. Therefore, implementing a user friendly interaction method to allow users to make comparisons themselves became important.</p>

<p><img src="http://everittcreative.me/assets/thesis/Screen_Shot_2015-12-11_at_11.58.29_AM_copy_copy.png" alt="Popular surf locations Australia" /></p>

<p>The results of this experiment generated the most complete picture of the contemporary surfing community. The amount of surf’s per location were visualised which showed popularity on the west coast of United States, Surfers Paradise and the Gold Coast on the east coast of Australia, and the surfing mecca, Indonesia. By visualising swell size the south western coast of Australia along with the North Shore of Hawaii were identified as a popular big wave surf areas. Visualising the data over time showed the increase in surfing frequency due to seasons. Visualising the movements of surfers from surf spot to surf spot identified where surfers were coming from ‘in search of the perfect waves’. Furthermore, the visualisation identified users participating in non-surfing sports. 
Figure #. Visualisations showing popular surf spots. Red indicates a large amount of surfs.</p>

<p>The methods identified in this experiment came together to visualise a surfing nation at a global level. The global mapping identified top locations and elite surfers, it also identified isolated surf spots and movement patterns between surf spots. Furthermore, the outliers were identified through a multivariate analysis as users participating in alternative activities while wearing the watch. The data has enough detail to begin visualising it on a relationship level. This level will be important in identifying the local tribes and bands of the neo-tribal structure defined by Stranger (2011). </p>

<h3 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h3>

<p>The purpose of the experiment phase was to identify important technological and aesthetic aspects that would define the final design brief. The first experiments implemented new web capabilities for tracking users and mobile tracking devices in the water to generate data, then implemented basic visualisation techniques to identify the validity of the data. The final experiment focused on the design of the data generated from the SearchGPS Watch, importantly, it investigated web graphic technologies for visualising large datasets. The result of these experiments was a brief.</p>

<p>Design a web based application that visualises the surfing nation, hierarchy aspects of the surfing subculture, a surfer’s pilgrimage, and a surfer’s personal experience at a surf spot. The application should be both, interactive and allow the user to explore the database. Lastly, users of the SearchGPS Watch can ‘login’ and compare themselves within the surfing community.</p>

<p>The cultural criteria emerged from comparisons between Stranger’s (2011) model of the surfing substructure, and the analysis of the data generated from Experiment Two and three. Experiment two established a method of visualising the act of surfing itself and provided the most in-depth view into surfing a wave. This combined with the global view established in the third experiment to create the two extremes of the database. These two views are representative of Lima’s (2006) macro and micro scales of visualisation. Therefore, the development of this design focused on establishing a third, relationship view of the database which sits between the macro and micro views utilising the pilgrimage visualisation methods identified in Experiment One. For the development of this design, these views were defined as follows: global, a macro view of global surfing locations, visualising the surfing nation; local, a relationship view of a specific surfing location, visualising hierarchy and pilgrimage; and personal, a micro view of an individual surf, visualising the act of surfing.</p>

<p>Experiment Three also demonstrated that interactivity within the data visualisation was important due to the large amount of data and the multivariate nature of the database. Interactivity allows the user to explore the database at their own pace and to the level of their desired detail (within the limits defined by the designer). For example, the initial view of the visualisation may show swell sizes, whereas a certain viewer may be more interested in wave counts, top speeds, or certain surfers (professionals). The development of the design aimed to identify the most important and visually striking of the variable’s so that they could be shown initially, and then allow the user to explore the other variables.</p>

<p>The final part of the brief defines a need for users of the SearchGPS Watch to be able to view a representation of themselves within the surfing community. The ability for analysis of oneself among the community is an important factor in the visualisation. Shoe (2014) describes that participants within personal informatics are invested in either personal knowledge, personal improvement, or the desire to share and compete with others. Therefore, by allowing SearchGPS Watch user’s to view themselves in a global, local and personal context, the design aims to establish this self-reflection users have invested in.</p>
