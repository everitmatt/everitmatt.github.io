Surf media and the development of audio-visual technology have played an important part in influencing the surfing subculture. Beginning with the first surf photographers and filmmakers documenting exotic locations, to the latest use of the web for live webcasting of the Associated Surfing Professionals (ASP) world tour. The latest technological step for surfing comes in the form of Rip Curl’s Search GPS smart watch; this allows surfers to map their ‘sessions’ in terms of location, wave count, speed and etc.
This research will be an investigation into the visualisation of surfing data collected from new media technologies with interactive videography to provide a unique insight into the surfing experience and its subculture.

My belief is that with the emergence of new wearable technologies and the growing inter-connectivity these devices will allow a new wave of change within surfing. One that allows a unique way of documenting surfing while still aligning with key aspects of surf subculture.

With the introduction of wearable technologies that adhere to the stylistic rules of the surfing ‘brand’ one can track how a surfer may move within his local break, to how he moves within an unknown break, to how he moves geographically from break to break and country to country.

It is important for these new technologies to align with the existing style associated with the surfing subculture so that it will be accepted by surfers, but also to introduce new aspects for the development of the subculture. This research will investigate new techniques for media design within surfing using new and emerging technologies, to design a system that could benefit the designer and the surfer. This approach will be backed up by a research design project focusing on the experiential aspects of surfing that retains the surfing identity. Some ethnographic and sociological research has been done on the many surfing subcultures around the world. However, little design research has been produced. This research aims to contribute to the anthropological discourse while introducing a discourse around design research for surfing.
