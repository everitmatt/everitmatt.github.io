The modernisation of the urban space has changed the individuals relationship with, and perception of, place and time. The introduction of artificial lighting inside and out has had a major effect on a persons relationship with urban places after dark, and the way these places are being perceived and experienced. The change altered the fundamental notions of freedom and being. The photographic role here is to understand and portray the urban space at night as a horrific and intriguing environment. For some people this is enforcing there perception of the space as unsafe and intimidating, while altering others perception of well lit urban space.
