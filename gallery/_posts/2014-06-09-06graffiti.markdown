Graffiti explores our perception of space through geometry and colour. Using the simple method of stencil and paint the alley is transformed from dull dreary to explosive and colourful.

The craft paper creating the stencil reinforces our 3d perception of the structures in the alley, however as it builds up it hints to the ulterior motive of the shape it is creating. When the stencil falls away the objective of the design is revealed, breaking the viewer’s perspective with string geometrical and colour contrasts. Inspiration for this piece of work comes from Tilts ‘Panic Room’ and Georges Rousse’s ‘Art Project in Miyagi’.
