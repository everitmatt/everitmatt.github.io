Gone surfing is an interactive data visualisation communicating what I know about surfing through the visualisation of data generated by surfers around the world. As part of a Master of Design Innovation, research was undertaken to ground this personal knowledge in literature and develop methods of visualising the data to efficiently communicate aspects of the surfing subculture. Through this research a series of views of the surfing nation were established. *Global*, *local*, and *personal* views each communicated hierarchical, nomadic, and experiential aspects of surfing.

The data used in the visualisation was generated by Rip Curlâ€™s SearchGPS Watch. The watch allows surfers to track statistics while they are surfing such as wave count, top speed, and distances. The database that this product created has become a digitised representation of the surfing community.

The live version of the application is currently in re-development and cannot be viewed at this time.
